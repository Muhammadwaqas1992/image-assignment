<br><br><br>
<p>Turn on the Saute mode of your <strong> instant pot</strong> . Once hot, add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf, cumin seeds, and saute for a few seconds.</p>
<br>
<p>continue to cook in the Saute mode. Add the <strong> marinated chicken</strong>  and cook for 3 minutes. Then add garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Flip the chicken and cook<br>
for another 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the<strong>  bottom</strong>  of the pot to make sure there is no food sticking at the bottom to avoid any burning.</p>
<br>
<p>Add onion, tomato, coriander leaves, mint leaves, tandoori masala powder, and mix well. Cook this for a minute. Now spread it evenly to cover the base of the instant pot.</p>

<br>
<p>Add the <strong> soaked (and drained)</strong>  rice and spread it evenly over the chicken. Add Â½ teaspoon salt and 1 cup water. See that all the rice is under the liquid. Close the <br>
lid of your instant pot and see that the pressure valve is in the sealing position. Select the Manual / Pressure High function and set the timer to 6 minutes.</p>
<br>
<p>Let the <strong>  pressure</strong> release naturally for 5 minutes. Then release any remaining pressure.</p>
<br>
<p>Open the instant pot and <strong>gently</strong>  mix the cooked rice with chicken using a silicone spatula to prevent the hot rice from breaking when tossed.</p>
<br>
<p><strong> Garnish</strong>  with some more coriander leaves, mint leaves, and enjoy.</p>

<h1 id="FAQ"> FAQ:</h2>
<br><br>
<p><strong>What rice can be used to prepare biryani?</strong>
  <br><br>
<strong><i>Basmati</i></strong> is the most preferred variety of rice for preparing a biryani. There are several <br>
varieties of Basmati available in the market. I generally prefer to get aged instead of newly <br>
harvested basmati rice as they are more flavorful and become fluffy when cooked.
<br><br>
You can also use other rice varieties such as Jeera rice or Jasmine rice if Basmati is not<br>
available. Ofcourse, the size of these rice varieties when cooked are much smaller and are more starchy than<br>
Basmati. If using any rice other than Basmati, it is best to let them cool to room temperature after the partial<br>
cooking stage, and then add them to your biryani for final cooking.
<br><br><br>
<strong>What cut of chicken to use for biryani?</strong>
<br><br>
Chicken thighs and legs or <strong><i>drumsticks</i></strong> are the most preferred parts of chicken to use in the<br>
Biryani. Since biryani is cooked on a low flame for a long time, thighs and drumsticks retain the moisture / juiciness when served.
<br><br>

For a more healthy biryani, you can definitely use <strong><i>chicken</i></strong> breast, but in my experience they tend <br>
to dry out and turn chewy compared to chicken thighs.
<br><br>
<strong>Should the chicken be marinated before preparing biryani?</strong>
<br><br>
Marinating chicken for at least 15 minutes with salt, lemon juice, and a pinch of turmeric is highly recommended. Marinating <br>
ensures that the meat is tenderized and flavorful.
<br><br>
<strong>Should we use yogurt to marinate the chicken?</strong>
<br><br>
Yogurt is definitely recommended if you are using chicken breast in the biryani. If you are using only chicken thighs and <br>
drumsticks, yogurt can be skipped.
